(1) Input the radius: Start by obtaining the radius of the sphere (denoted as 𝑟 r).

(2) Understand the formula: The surface area 
A of a sphere is given by the formula:

𝐴 = 4πr^2
 
where, 
    π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.

(3) Calculate the square of the radius: Compute r**2 (radius multiplied by itself).

(4) Multiply by 4: Multiply the squared radius by 4.

(5) Multiply by π: Finally, multiply the result by π to get the surface area.

(6) Output the result: The resulting value is the surface area of the sphere.
